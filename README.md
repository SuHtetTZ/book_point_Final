The FastText word embedding file has been removed from the project due to its large size (approximately 7GB). Before running the project, please download the FastText model from the [official FastText website](https://fasttext.cc/). The required file is named **cc.en.300.bin**. Once downloaded, place the file in the following directory within the project:

```
src/main/resources/
```

Ensure the file is named **cc.en.300.bin** to match the current project configuration. If you decide to use a different file name or location, be sure to update the code accordingly to reflect these changes.
